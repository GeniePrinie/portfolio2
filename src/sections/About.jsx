        Hi, I am Prinyapon Prinyanut. I was born in Bangkok, Thailand, and moved
        on my own to the U.S. when I was 14 years old to attend High School. My
        family followed me to the U.S. a few years later, where they all live to
        this day. I attended the University of Colorado Denver where I got a
        Bachelor's degree in biology. I found my passion for programming after
        this degree, and completely shifted my focus towards frontend
        development, instead of biology. I am currently a student, studying
        frontend development at Noroff, and living in Oslo. In my free time I
        like to go rock climbing with my friends, explore food from different
        cultures, and bake. I speak four different languages and I am eager to
        learn more in the future.
